# Weekly-reflections---09-02-24
What I did this week

At the beginning of the week, I completed the Git course we started last week. I learned a lot from the git course, I learned about some very useful git commands and got to grasp concepts which were completely new to me.Once I understood the basics, I decided to practice using the advanced commands which seem to offer the most convenience. Among these commands were git rebase, git revert, git reverse, git cherry-pick, git describe and git tag. I'm pretty comfortable with my understanding of the git commands and using git with github.

My other focus for the week was on learning to use the terminal. I started with learning the basic terminal commands to use on the ubuntu command line. I have learned how to create, delete, edit, move and copy files and folders using the terminal. I also learned how to install and update ubuntu software packages using terminal commands. I also learned about ssh keys and how to generate public and private keys using the terminal. 

We got to practice using github as well. Warrick tasked us with making different contributions to a single project. This exercise helped me get adapted to the workflow of using git to complete and make changes to a project. I also got a better understanding of the concepts I was learning from the git course we started last week, concepts like git pull, git fetch and git merge.

I enjoy the topics we had to cover this week, it may have been simple and easy to learn, but I realised how powerful and useful what I've learnt could potentially be.
